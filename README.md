# ProxiPal
A package to support PLA development, early stage validation studies and assay kit production

ProxiPal is a Windows/Linux/MacOSX-compatible package to support PLA development, early stage validation studies and assay kit production by

* archiving and analysing PLA data
* generating reports using PLA data
* managing research samples
* batch and inventory control for PLA kits
* quality control monitoring
* pooling experimental data for further analysis
* increasing data access beyond the development team

ProxiPal is not intended to be:

* a substitute for clinical LIMS/LIS systems
* a substitute for clinical reports
* whether ProxiPal can stand-in, or be modified for the above, is for users to decide.

ProxiPal aims to balance the flexibility required for experimental development against the rigidity of clinical protocol and record-keeping. For example:

* technology research can demand experimental changes to controls, plate plans and standards, reagent selection and design.
* new technologies require different mathematical models and statistical practices to be explored.
* valuable development data often lies outside the cut-offs that clinical standards might apply.
* acquisition and analysis cannot be limited to specific instruments or software versions; because of this ProxiPal analysis must be adaptable to different data formats
* different submissions provide different sample information; thus ProxiPal sample management must accommodate different types of information (i.e. research groups, patient data etc.) and incompleteness (i.e. privacy, study disclosures etc.).

For this reason Proxipal users submit data, instrument, sample and QC info largely via exported .csv or .txt files. Protected excel templates are available to standardise these inputs.

ProxiPal does have the underlying functionality to accommodate greater document control, restricted analysis and fully automated reporting pipelines however these features would need to be added in and would be contingent on instrument selection, version control for the software used to run these instruments, and routine experimental set ups. Adding these options would need to be assessed based on how the PLA will be used in the future.
